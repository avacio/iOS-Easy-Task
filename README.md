# iOS-Easy-Task
Using the latest version of Xcode, create an app that has one button. When the button is pressed, the current temperature in Houston Texas is shown in a text field. By current temperature, we mean the temperature when we run your app.

# Your comments or assumptions
- very basic app, but can be refactored for wider use
- emoji support for the following main weather conditions:
        Clouds: ☁️
        Mist, Atmosphere: 🌫
        Rain, Drizzle: ☔️
        Snow: ❄️
        Thunderstorm, Extreme: ⛈
        Clear: 🌞
        
        -> app will display emoji given Houston's current weather codition
