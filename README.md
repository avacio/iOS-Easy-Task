# iOS-Easy-Task
Using the latest version of Xcode, create an app that has one button. When the button is pressed, the current temperature in Houston Texas is shown in a text field. By current temperature, we mean the temperature when we run your app.

# Your comments or assumptions
- very basic app, but can be refactored for wider use
- even displays emojis given Houston's current weather condition
- emoji support for the following main weather conditions: <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clouds: ☁️ <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mist, Atmosphere: 🌫 <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rain, Drizzle: ☔️ <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Snow: ❄️ <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thunderstorm, Extreme: ⛈ <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clear: 🌞 <br />
